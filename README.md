TransMapper is a light web mapping application targeting 'big' census data. 

It is developed by team GeoVis using 6 Javascript libraries: d3.v2.min.js , cartogram.js , natural.js , topojson.js , jquery-1.10.2.min.js and colorbrewer.js.

TransMapper aims to transform the way of mapping the census by providing a cartogram-based visualizer and a simple natural language interface for filtering attributes. 

Based on previous work by [Shawn Allen](https://github.com/shawnbot/d3-cartogram/), TransMapper is designed and built 

by Wei Chen (David) captain, Bo Zhao (Jakob) and Xu Zhe (Lucky). 

d3.js does most of the heavy lifting and colorbrewer delivers blind safe colors for mapping.
